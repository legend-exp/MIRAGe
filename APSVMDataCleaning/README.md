 AP-SVM Data Cleaning
=============

The Affinity Propagation - Support Vector Machine (AP-SVM) data cleaning model production code for LEGEND is found here.

## Dependencies / Software Requirements

- Python >= 3.9
- Machine learning packages: scikit-learn
- LEGEND packages: [pygama](https://github.com/legend-exp/pygama), [legendstyles](https://github.com/legend-exp/legend-styles/tree/dev), [pylegendmeta](https://github.com/legend-exp/pylegendmeta)
- Other packages: matplotlib, seaborn, multiprocessing

## Workflow

1. Open the  ```data``` directory. There you will find notebooks and configuration files to create the training dataset.

2. Open the ```train``` directory. There you will find notebooks and scripts to train AP and SVM.

3. [OPTIONAL] Open the ```vis``` directory. There you will find notebooks and scripts to produce a 3D visualization of the trained SVM model. Consider running this only if you are producing a plot for a presentation or a paper as it is computationally expensive.
